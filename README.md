# Train-Detection-API


This is a FastAPI-based backend system for receiving and logging train detections from smart sensors and AI-powered cameras. Designed to support real-time monitoring and rerouting for road traffic impacted by trains, this API is part of the larger "RoundAbout" project.

## Features

- Accepts POST requests from train detection devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Arduino, AI cameras)
- Validates and logs data such as location, timestamp, detection method, and confidence score
- Exposes endpoints to retrieve all detections or individual records by ID
- Can be extended to support rerouting apps or traffic management systems

## Tech Stack

- Backend Framework: FastAPI (Python 3.8+)
- Data Model: Pydantic
- Storage: In-memory (temporary; upgrade to database recommended)
- API Docs: Auto-generated at `/docs` and `/redoc`

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

API Usage
POST /api/train-detection
Submit a new train detection.

Example request body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "crossing_id": "X001",
  "latitude": 40.7132,
  "longitude": -74.0060,
  "timestamp": "2025-05-14T08:20:00Z",
  "detected_by": ["laser", "camera_ai"],
  "confidence_score": 0.97,
  "train_direction": "northbound"
}
Example response:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Train detection recorded",
  "detection_id": "uuid-generated-id"
}
GET /api/train-detection
Returns all recorded detections.

GET /api/train-detection/{detection_id}
Returns a specific detection by its unique ID.

Future Plans
Replace in-memory storage with persistent database (e.g., SQLite or Firebase)

Add API key authentication

Create dashboard frontend to view and manage detections

Integrate with real-time rerouting application logic
